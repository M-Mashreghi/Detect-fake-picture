# Detect-fake-picture
In this project, we use fake and real pictures of mountains, sea, and forests to detect fake ones.

In this project, we used many classifications like SVM, and logistic regression for detecting and used clustering to see what we get.

we extracted the mean of each colour (RGB), Saturation, Hue, Watermark, Quantization table, ELA(error level analysis), Fourier, Noise analysis, Wavelet, Luminance Gradient, Local Binary Pattern, HOG features, and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) as features and use them in training also we use PCA to reduce the dimension.

for more information, the report file is in repo.

for watermark, we extracted these two photos from each picture to figure out if it's fake or not!
